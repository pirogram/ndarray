  N-dimensional array is a foundational data structure in the field of data analysis. The usual workflow is that you'll take a bunch of observations (e.g. temperature measurements from a sensor at weather station), load them in n-dimensional array, transform it into a suitable form and feed the n-dimensional array into some algorithm (simple statistical summaries or deep neural networks).

  In this package, we'll develop an understanding of `ndarray`, the n-dimensional array data structure in `NumPy`.
