title: Modeling in N-Dimensional Array
--- |

  Let's talk about the weather. Let's say, in the city of Bombay, there is a weather station. This weather station has a sensor. This sensor produces a reading of temperature (in degree Celsius) every hour. Let's say, it generated the following reading at 6am yesterday:

  If our program was recording this, we could use an `integer` to hold this information. Something like following:

  ```python
  temp = 31
  ```

  Now, this weather station has not one but three sensors. And all three sensors generate a reading every hour. Let's say, at 6am yesterday, these readings were generated by the sensors:

  If our program was recording this information, we could model this information as a dictionary. For example:

  ```python
  temp_readings = {
    "sensor-1": 31,
    "sensor-2": 32,
    "sensor-3": 31
  }
  ```

  We could also model this information as an array. Each entry in the array is a reading from a sensor. Something like:

  ```python
  temp_readings = np.array([31, 32, 31])
  ```

  While the dictionary approach is better from the readability point of view, the array approach is better from computing point of view. If we wanted to take the average of readings generated by three sensors, here would be corresponding approaches for dictionary and arrays:

  ```python
  # Dictionary approach
  temp_readings = {
    "sensor-1": 31,
    "sensor-2": 32,
    "sensor-3": 31
  }

  temp_average = sum(temp_readings.values())/3
  ```

  With array, it would be more compute efficient:

  ```python
  temp_readings = np.array([31, 32, 31])
  temp_average = np.avg( temp_readings)
  ```

  But wait, the city of Bombay has two different weather stations. Each weather station has three sensors. And all sensors at all stations produce temperature reading every hour. So, with two weather stations, our data could look like the following:

  ![](assets/img/two-d.png)

  In our program, we could use an array of array (or a two-dimensional array) to hold this data. It could look like the following in code:

  ```python
  temp_readings = np.array([
    [31, 32, 31], # station 1
    [29, 28, 30]  # station 2
  ])
  ```

  Now, to complete the picture, these stations generate readings every hour. So, if we were to look at one day's data, it would look something like:

  ![](assets/img/three-d.png)

  In our program, this can be modeled as an array of array of array (or a three-dimensional array). It would look like the following:

  ```python
  temp_readings = np.array([
    [     # 6AM
      [31, 32, 31], # station 1
      [29, 28, 30]  # station 2
    ], [  # 7AM
      [32, 34, 33], # station 1
      [33, 32, 34]  # station 2
    ], [  # 8AM
      [33, 32, 34], # station 1
      [32, 33, 33]  # station 2
    ]
  ])
  ```

  One question you may ask is why model this data as n-dimensional array? There are so many other ways this could be modeled. For now, let's just say that n-dimensional array is one of the many ways in which we could model this data. In subsequent topics, we'll see the usefulness of this particular data structure.
